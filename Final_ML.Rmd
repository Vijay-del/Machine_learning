#Finding the brand loyality

# Description of the clusters:
# Cluster 1 :  
# There are high number of customers who belong to low economic level.
# The value of "Trans/Brands Runs","Vol/Tran" are low and high average price.
# The most of the customers in the cluster 1 not utilizes the promotions for purchase, some utilizes the promotion "other promo%" at high rate and few utilizes the promotion "Promo6%".
# The customers made least purchases from price catalog 1,2,4 and high purchases from catalog 3.
# The selling propoption is low except 14th catalog.

# Cluster 2 :
# The cluster consists of high economic status customers.
# There are low house hold members, availability of TV, Affluence Index, brand runs, number of transactions, volume of transactions.
# The average price of the purchases is low.
# The purchases fall in Price catalog 1 and selling propoption in catalog 8,10,12,13 & 15.

# Cluster 3 :
# There are more number of educated people, house hold members, tv availability, affluence index, number of brands and high frequency of purchase.
# The customers are less utilizing the promotion discount "Pur Vol No Promo - %","Pur Vol Other Promo %" and higly utilizing "Pur Vol Promo 6 %".
# The purchases fall under price catalogs 2,4&5. Less under catalog 3
# The selling proposition falls under catalog 5,6,7,9,11 and 15. Least in catalog 14
